## TDD is about "divide and conquer" code

Self-dosing the amount of complexity you want to solve And Planning wisely the battles you choose to face
 
lead to

Less energy spent on tasks being as fast And Well designed code


## How to use the functions

1) `source set_aliases_for_bash_session.sh`
2) use `rwip` when you have set a small goal in a form of a failing test
3) use `gwip` when the small goal is achieved
4) use `fwip` when you want your contribution to be easier to read/mantain/change/replace
5) go to 2 until you have delivered business value
6) did this system improve your experience? why? why not? did you miss something?
7) keep delivering business value
